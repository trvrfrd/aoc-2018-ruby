my solutions for [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018)
in Ruby even though I already know Ruby because I want to review Ruby

the solutions are all executable, e.g. from the project root directory:
```
$ ./1/solutions.rb
```
or from the directory for a given day:
```
$ cd 1/
$ ./solutions.rb
```

they will use `/usr/bin/env ruby` as the interpreter
so hopefully you've got that set up :O
